# AdventJS Progress by midudev ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **AdventJS** repository! ðŸ‘‹ This repository is dedicated to saving my progress as I tackle the coding challenges from the [AdventJS](https://adventjs.dev) event created by **midudev**.

## Disclaimer ðŸš¨
The solutions in this repository are my personal attempts to solve the challenges.  
While they work for the given test cases, they might **not always be the most optimal or elegant solutions**.  
Feel free to explore and suggest improvements!
